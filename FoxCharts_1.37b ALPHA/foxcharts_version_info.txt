Relevant information for the current release - FOXCHARTS 1.20 PRODUCTION RELEASE

+++ PRODUCTION RELEASE +++

VERY IMPORTANT
====================================

This version uses the latest version of GdiPlusX - 1.20

FoxCharts needs it for the latest improvements
So, if you already have a System.App version installed, make sure to update it replacing with this new one, since FoxCharts / GdiPlusX could make some confusions locating the correct version.
It is safe to use the new version, don't be afraid to replace your production version - but anyway, keep a copy of your old version just in case some issues related to this new version appear.

FEATURES since version 1.00 RC
====================================
New property - "OldStyleProperties"
*** IMPORTANT NOTE:  Property "oldstyleproperties" indicates whether you are using the original way (.FieldValue1).  However, the default for this variable is .F., so charts created with original way will fail until this property is set.


! Restored Enumeration types for "3D Bars" and "Stacked Area", according to Version 0.40
So, now 3D Bars have the enumeration 11, while Stacked Area goes back to 10.
That would be a problem for existing applications that use 10 as the value, and Version 0.40 has already more than 1400 downloads.


New property for animation, when a slice of Pie or Dougnut is detached
"PieDetachAnimationSteps" - Integer



Info for version 1.00.3 RC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several fixes
Tooltips positions
Fixes for pgFrames



Info for version 1.00.4 RC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're developing a CHM help file. This is still very crude, but contains already some very basic information that you may find useful.

New propety - "Debug"
Creates the file "FoxCharts.log" that will contain relevant information about errors generated by FoxCharts.
If you find some errors, please do generate this file, setting the property "Debug" to .T. - TRUE, and recreate the bug.
Please send the log file to vfpimaging@hotmail.com

New public array property: "aCoord"
Array that stores information about the object that is under the mouse, like X, Y, Width, Height, Value, Legend, Start, Sweep, ChartIndex, RECNO(), ObjType. See HELP for detailed information about the available info.

Supports more than one line of text in the Axis2 text



Info for version 1.00.7 RC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now when an empty cursor is passed , only the background and titles will be drawn - no error raised
Fixed "GetAdJustedAngle", by CWollenhaupt - Pie and Doughnut charts were been drawn only on the right side
"FieldAxis2" supports Date values
Fixed samples
New samples included


Info for version 1.00.9 RC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New event "ShapeToolTips"
Improved property stuff
New sample ChartSample_Tooltips


Info for version 1.00.10 RC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix on angle calculation for the correct mouse detection at the 1st quadrant for Pie / doughnut charts
Tweaked YAxis legend drawing, now using the Canvas' Graphics object, in order to keep quality in EMF output


Info for version 1.00.12 RC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New property "ScaleDivider"
Numeric, the value that the scales must be divided. Useful when the scale values are very big.
Useful when the values are very big, and scales could be reduced, eg. Supposing you have the maximum value of 790,000. 
For this case it would be recommended to divide the scale values by 1000, for a better exibition. 
You need also to remind your user that the values were divided, setting the YAxis.Caption to eg. "values in thousands"

Fixed the scale calculation. A wrong chart was generated when açç the values were equal, or when a single column of
data was used


Info for version 1.00.14 RC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed mouse relative position calculation. Now tooltips appear correctly being FoxCharts in any kind of object: Form, Container or PageFrame
Added new assert's in order to provide more accurate error messages

New property - "Shadow" - Logical, determines if a shadow will be drawn instead of the 3d - depth efect. Works for Bars, Pie and Doughnut types


Improved Gradient effects - now you can specify the locations where the gradient destination color will be in the shape
New Properties

"GradientPosition" - Numeric, a value from 0 through 1 that specifies where, along any radial from the center of the path to the path's boundary, the center color will be at its highest intensity. A value of 1 (the default) places the highest intensity at the center of the path. 

"GradientType" - Integer, 
      0 = SigmaBell - gradient brush that changes color starting from the center of the path outward to the path's boundary. The transition from one color to another is based on a bell-shaped curve. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bs92fkt6.aspx
      1 = Triangular - gradient with a center color and a linear falloff to each surrounding color. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c5yfy1y0(VS.80).aspx

"GradientInvertColors" - Logical, determines if the gradient start and destination colors will be inverted.


The center point of the gradient color of an ellipse can be easilly changed too. This brings the possibility to control exactly where the gradient will get the destination color. Just setting the 2 new properties below:
"PieGradCenterAngle" - Numeric, the angle that the desired Center Point for the gradient brush will be applied (0-360). Use together with "PieGradCenterDistance"
"PieGradCenterDistance" - Numeric, the distance from the center that the desired Center Point for the gradient brush will be applied (-2, +2). Use       together with "PieGradCenterAngle"


The sample "ChartsSample_New" was adapted to use these new properties.
Select the colors tab, and play with the spinners



Info for version 1.00.15 RC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New property
"ShapeMousePointer" - Numeric, Specifies the shape of the mouse pointer when the mouse is over a shape of the chart at run time
"GradientShapeDirection" - Integer, (0-3) determines the gradient direction for gradient brush charts: 0 - horizontal; 1 - vertical; 2 - diagonal1 ; 3 - diagonal 2
Improved "ChartsSample_New.scx" in order to show the new properties working, and also allowing to change colors interactively



Info for version 1.00.16 RC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties "aColors" and "SingleData" have been renamed in order to become for public use.
"aColors" - ReadOnly, Array that contains information about the current colors for the chart. Useful when working with random colors.
"SimgleData" - Logical, ReadOnly, tells if the current chart is based on single data, eg. Pie, Doughnut, Single Bars



Info for version 1.00.17 RC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New "SaveToFile" method

PARAMETERS:
tcFile - character, the destination file name. Make sure to add the extension, otherwise the chart will be saved in PNG format.
tnQuality - numeric, determines the image quality to be used when a JPEG file is saved. From 0 (low quality) to 100 (best quality).

Saves the current chart to a file in the image format compatible with Gdi+: Bmp, Png, Jpeg, Gif, Tiff and Emf.
Just send the file name as a parameter, and FoxCharts will save the current chart based on the file extension.
Usege:
Thisform.FoxCharts1.SaveToFile("c:\MyChart.Png") && Png image file
Thisform.FoxCharts1.SaveToFile("c:\MyChart.Jpg", 50) && 50% quality Jpg.

For full control while saving, or for using some specific encoders, you can access the "oBmp" property of FoxCharts and use the GdiPlusX commands available for the bitmap object.

Fix in ShapeLegends alignment
The property "ChartsCount" now allows to be changed after the class was instantiated - by Matt Weinberder

When Click and DblClick events are fired, 4 new properties are populated, in order to inform about the current chart and the shape that was clicked:
 
CurrValue - the value of the shape
CurrLegend - the associated legend
CurrIndex - the index number to be used in the aCoord() index to obtain more info about the current shape
CurrObjType - the type of object - Pie, Rect or Legend
 
Sample of usage, codes that you may put in your DblClick event:
 
 
LOCAL lnValue, lcLegend, lnCoordIndex, lcObjType
lnValue = This.CurrValue
lcLegend = This.CurrLegend
lnCoordIndex = This.CurrIndex 
lcObjType = This.CurrObjType
MESSAGEBOX("Value : " + TRANSFORM(lnValue) + CHR(13) + ;
   "Legend : " + TRANSFORM(lcLegend) + CHR(13) + ;
   "Object type : " + lcObjType ;
   , 64, [Code in the "DblClick" event of FoxCharts])

Tweaked property descriptions to take benefit from the new cool PEM editor possibilities

Fixed Shapes mapping  - Thanks to A. Roy CHowdhurry
Fixed BarSpaceBetween - When big values caused some calculation errors

Removed _Memberdata scripts
Tweaked property descriptions in order to use new PEM Editor's scripts for getting colors and enumerated property values.



Info for version 1.19 RC
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 - Structure modifications
Removed class FoxCharts_Base - there was no more need to use a separate class to be able to 
use more _Memberdada, since new PEM Editor 4 optimized FoxCHarts Memberdata to use less than half the 
original size

2 - Fixes
Fix in "MouseLeave()" event was firing wrongly when ChangeColorOnMouse was .T.
Fix in Fields(n).ShowValuesOnShape was not working as expected when property "OldStylePoperties" was .T.
http://vfpx.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=60082
Fix in API call declaration, to use the GdiPlusX original ALIAS for the GDI+ functions: GdipSetPathGradientSurroundColorsWithCount and xfcGdipSetPathGradientSurroundColorsWithCount
Tweak to avoid Windows7 bug that does not work with PictureVal in VFP9 prior to SP2. In that case, the rendering will be forced to the disk (using RenderMode=0)

3 - Property descriptions and PEM Editor 4
Added new DOPEs in properties
All the property descriptions have been revised, and from now on, the usage of PEM Editor 4 is strongly and enthusiastically recommended in order to provide the best user experience for FoxCharts, allowing the developer to better visualize what each property does, as well as the possible values accepted for each property.

4 - Getting chart properties enhancements
Jim Nelson tweaked some methods as well, in order to provide new possibilities for saving properties, 
and a fix for Scales calculation.
GetChartProperties now takes another parameter to indicate whether property descriptions should be included.  (This only works from within the IDE, not in APP or EXE).  In my pageframe, I've added a checkbox for this on the 'Properties' tab.
SaveChartProperties now takes a parameter that allows you to skip saving altogether if already saved.

5 - Scale calculation tweaks
For calculating scale values, the method _CalculateScale was fixed. It corrects two problems encountered
The problems had to do with some instances where the scales were set odd, and also problems when setting the minimum value to something other than zero.

6 - Tooltips
Tooltips will obbey their parent configuration, allowing to have different tooltips formatting when having more than one FoxCHarts object available in the current form.
Tooltips will be shown even if the form does not have the focus

7 - Samples
Tweaks in "ChartsSample_Builder"
- Send2MSWord - fix to check if the clipboard is empty before drawing the chart image in the .DOC (by Koen Piller)
- Tweaked Data grid behavior; grid will adjust its size according to the current chart specifications.
- Fixed background gradient behavior; now the original secondary color for background is being saved, and will be restored to original chanfing the Gradient Level spinner

ChartsSample_Dynamic.scx

New improvements in ChartsSample_Builder:
- Generate fully working script to reproduce the current chart (in Properties tab)
- Add or remove rows of data
- Add or remove columns of data (fields), allowing to change the ChartsCount dynamically

New ChartTypes allowing Full-Stacked charts
3 - Vertical Full-Stacked Bars
15 - Horizontal Full-Stacked Bars
16 - Horizontal Full-Stacked Area

These new charts are also called the 100% Stacked charts.
They are useful for comparing the percent values of several series for the same points arguments.
The labels in shapes can specify whether real values are shown for each point label, or the representative percentage;
   and also change the visibility of point labels.


New properties: 
PieDirection
Integer (0-1), determines the direction that the slices will be drawn in Pie or Doughnut charts *** 0 = Clockwise, 1 = Anticlockwise

ShowPercentages
Logical, for full-stacked charts, determines if the default ShapeLegend and Tooltip text will show as Percentage
instead of values 
Valid for the chart types:
*    3 - Full-Stacked Bars
*    7 - Simple Bars
*    8 - Multiple Bars
*   12 - Horiz. Simple Bars
*   13 - Horiz. Multiple Bars
